UX Problem\r\n\r\nThe Customize page does not provide an effective interface for interacting with the variables.less file. \r\n\r\n#### Proposed Solution\r\nAdd a simple color swatch next to each of the options in the Bootstrap 3.x color selection section.\r\n\r\n#### Motivation\r\nThere have been a number of requests both on the 2.x and 3.x branches to add interactivity but thus far there have been no pull requests that I have seen. E.g. [2804](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2804), [2578](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2578) etc.\r\n\r\n#### Complexity\r\nThere is slightly more complex markup but it's only from using a bootstrap row/col to controll collapsing in different viewports.\r\n\r\n\tJavaScript: +9 lines  \r\n\tCSS:       +11 lines  \r\n\tHTML:       +7 lines/color  \r\n\r\n#### Drawbacks\r\nSince the `attr(data-color px)` style CSS selectors are still not that well implemented I had to use a little inline styling. Maybe the community can help find a better solution."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/bootstrap/issues/8238","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/bootstrap/issues/8238/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/bootstrap/issues/8238/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/bootstrap/issues/8238/events","html_url":"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/8238","id":15794475,"number":8238,"title":"Cross-Over

So I was wondering if you are going to change that route and move all property values (mostly color related and some fonts related as well, from specific files) to variables.less\r\n\r\nFor example (v3.0)\r\naccordion.less\r\n.accordion-group {}\r\nborder: 1px solid #e5e5e5;\r\ncould be\r\nborder: @border-width-small solid @accordion-group-border-color;\r\n\r\nor even instead of solid (@border-style-one, or @border-style-two etc etc)\r\n\r\nHope you catch my drift?\r\n\r\nWithout this v3.0 will be not so shiny, as this will rock v3.0 because I have been and still see people asking how to override core styles without loosing upgrade on stackoverflow etc etc.\r\n\r\nI found you have done is already at several places but I would like to see complete overhaul of this.\r\n\r\nHope

Unfortunately many of the font colors in the file navs.less are hard coded, instead of being based on variables defined in variables.less file.   Makes it difficult to change menu appearance.    (I'm using twitter-bootstrap-v2.3.2-1-g60b202d )\r\n\r\nI would think that best practice should be to define variables in variables.less and then compile bootstrap.css\r\n\r\nref: \r\n.nav > li > a:focus {...\r\n\r\n.nav-header {...\r\n\r\n.nav-list > .active > a,\r\n.nav-list > .active > a:hover,\r\n.nav-list > .active > a:focus {...

They allow me to beautifully present slightly longer forms in a table-like visual structure.\r\n\r\nA common pattern that I use is that I would like to present static/constant data within my form. A use case is that I have an account page where I don't allow changing the username, but would allow the user to change the password. Other examples are database ID:s, UUID:s etc. My guess that this is also a common use case for other Bootstrap users.\r\n\r\nOne solution to overcome the above issue would be to simply set `disabled=\"disabled\"` or `readonly=\"readonly\"`. My issue with these solutions is twofold:\r\n* By the look of them, they both hint to my user that there is a way to edit the username. They both kinda look like input boxes, but are grayed out and inmodifiable.\r\n* As of semantics, they are both contained in `<input>` tags. As a developer, it feels weird putting constants in `<input>` tags. They are clearly not input.\r\n\r\nAnother possible solution (modified from the documentation) is\r\n```html\r\n<form class=\"bs-docs-example form-horizontal\">\r\n  <div class=\"control-group\">\r\n    <label class=\"control-label\" for=\"inputUsername\">Username</label>\r\n    <div class=\"controls\">\r\n      JensRantil\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"control-group\">\r\n    <label class=\"control-label\" for=\"inputPassword\">Password</label>\r\n    <div class=\"controls\">\r\n      <input type=\"password\" id=\"inputPassword\" placeholder=\"Password\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"control-group\">\r\n    <div class=\"controls\">\r\n      <label class=\"checkbox\">\r\n        <input type=\"checkbox\"> Remember me\r\n      </label>\r\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn\">Sign in</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\nwhich yields\r\n\r\n![screenshot3](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/730342/642297/45856248-d355-11e2-8937-37c72555edb4.png)\r\n. As you can see, `form.form-horizontal` has artefacts for constant text.\r\n\r\nI've been visiting reading the [W3C spec for `disabled`/`readonly`](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.12) to understand their semantic intent, but the description is very technical. So far, I haven't understood whether any of them should cover my case.\r\n\r\nIf `disabled` is for the case of presenting constants, then I would propose Boostrap would style `input:disabled` as regular text without borders etc. However since I can't defer that from the spec, **my proposal is a class that avoids the artefact in the screenshot, a `.controls.controls-static` class with correct margin.**.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear your input on this."}]
